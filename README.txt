This is a project of mine that I am working on, for few reasons

-Learning more about python programming

-Learn more about AD, Windows, COM interfaces

-Provide a simple way for determining who has privileged access in your environment

In the long run, I'd like to make this available as a Class with a few methods of interest to admins/security practitioners/auditors

The program is developed using PYWin32, a great library making all Windows API's available with Python. Developed by Mark Hammond

Requirements are fairly simple:

-Latest version of Python on your desktop, I use ActivePython, which includes PyWin32 !
-Desktop being attached to the domain you want to browse, and being a Windows client, unfortunately PyWin32 does not work on Linux/MacOSX
